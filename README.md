#Aptus

Aptus is a Unity3D (v5.0) game that I am working on. It involves fitting procedurally generated shapes into holes. The idea is based
off of a game that I played a while ago. Unfortunately I can't remember the name or find a source! I think that it was called "Hypercube"
and it had 3D support.

Aptus is latin for 'fitted' or 'connected'.
